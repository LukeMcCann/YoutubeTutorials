Repository of resources for youtube series
#@Author Luke McCann
#<!---!!Disclaimer!!-->
<!--Code is my repos is not to be used for college, university or schoolwork,
this is a resource to go along with the youtube series only, where possible I will
use generic examples, if you do not write code yourself you will not learn! it is 
okay to make mistakes, and don't forget, reading is also important!-->

I realised that my repos are quite messy, so in preemption of my upcoming youtube help series I have created this repository
as to order resources by language/series.
